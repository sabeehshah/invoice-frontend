  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>

    I developed this project to practice developing a REST API and using it on the front-end. This application uses a <a
      href=""> REST API </a> developed with Spring Boot which uses JWT authentication for spring security.

  </p>

  <p>This front-end is developed in Angular and communicates with the REST API to handle authentication and CRUD functionality for invoices.</p>
